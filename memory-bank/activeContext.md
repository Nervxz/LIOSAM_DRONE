# Active Context: LIO-SAM with SICK MultiScan & WitMotion IMU

## Current Focus

The project has made significant progress with two of the three main components working independently:

1. **ros2_imu_ws**: Functional WitMotion HWT905 IMU driver, data visualization in RViz2 working
2. **sick_scan_ws**: Functional SICK MultiScan LiDAR driver, data visualization in RViz2 working
3. **lio_sam**: Newly cloned repository from GitHub, needs configuration and integration

The current focus is on:

1. **Integration**: Connecting the IMU data from ros2_imu_ws and LiDAR data from sick_scan_ws to LIO-SAM
2. **Configuration**: Creating LIO-SAM configuration files for the specific hardware combination
3. **Launch System**: Developing integrated launch files for the complete system
4. **Visualization**: Setting up RViz2 for the complete LIO-SAM system output

## Recent Developments

- Successfully implemented and tested the WitMotion HWT905 IMU driver (ros2_imu_ws)
- Successfully implemented and tested the SICK MultiScan LiDAR driver (sick_scan_ws)
- Cloned the LIO-SAM repository into the lio_sam directory
- Verified that both IMU and LiDAR data can be visualized in RViz2

## Active Decisions

### Integration Strategy
- Need to identify the correct topic names from IMU and LiDAR for LIO-SAM
- Need to determine appropriate transformations between sensor frames
- Need to configure LIO-SAM parameters for the specific sensor combination

### Network Configuration
- SICK LiDAR network connection is operational
- Need to ensure network settings are appropriate for real-time data processing

### Parameter Development
- Need to create customized LIO-SAM parameters for SICK MultiScan
- Need to verify coordinate frame consistency across all components
- Need to establish appropriate feature extraction settings
