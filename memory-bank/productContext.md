# Product Context: LIO-SAM with SICK MultiScan & WitMotion IMU

## Problem Statement
Reliable and accurate localization and mapping is a fundamental requirement for many robotic applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Traditional SLAM solutions often struggle with:

1. Sensor fusion complexity between LiDAR and IMU data
2. Real-time performance constraints
3. Drift accumulation over time
4. Integration challenges with specific hardware combinations

This project addresses these challenges by providing a production-ready implementation of LIO-SAM optimized for high-quality SICK MultiScan LiDARs and cost-effective WitMotion IMUs.
